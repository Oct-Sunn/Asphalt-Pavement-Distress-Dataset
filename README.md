# Asphalt-Pavement-Distress-Dataset
This repository contains the Asphalt Pavement Distress Dataset from the DSWMamba model research paper. It features labeled images of asphalt conditions across six distress categories, including cracks, potholes, and alligator cracks, supporting the development and evaluation of pavement distress detection models.

## Details:
### Dataset Purpose: 
To provide a comprehensive benchmark for the detection, classification, and analysis of asphalt pavement distress under real-world scenarios.
### Origin: 
The dataset was developed as part of the research for the paper titled "DSWMamba: A deep feature fusion mamba network for comprehensive detection of asphalt pavement distress", which demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. If you use this dataset, please cite the paper. Thank you.

## Distress Categories: The dataset includes six types of pavement distress:
Transverse Cracks
Longitudinal Cracks
Alligator Cracks
Potholes
Diagonal Cracks
Road Marking Distresses
Number of Images: 13,129 labeled images.

## Annotation Format: Annotations are provided in standard formats (e.g., COCO, YOLO) to facilitate use with popular object detection frameworks.
